This is not meant to be used as a standalone repo but as a submodule of [NnUtils](https://github.com/nnra6864/NnUtils/).
Linux audio capture relies on the [Pulse Audio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) and utilizes [parec](https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/doxygen/parec-simple_8c-example.html).
Pretty much all the code for capturing Windows audio is taken from [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio), specifically [CoreAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/tree/master/NAudio.Wasapi/CoreAudioApi).
